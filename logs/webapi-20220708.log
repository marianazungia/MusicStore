[2022-07-08 08:23:32  FTL]  The expression 'p.UserId' is invalid inside an 'Include' operation, since it does not represent a property access: 't => t.MyProperty'. To target navigations declared on derived types, use casting ('t => ((Derived)t).MyProperty') or the 'as' operator ('t => (t as Derived).MyProperty'). Collection navigation access can be filtered by composing Where, OrderBy(Descending), ThenBy(Descending), Skip or Take operations.

[2022-07-08 08:36:38  FTL]  Cannot use table 'AspNetUsers' for entity type 'AspNetUsers' since it is being used for entity type 'MusicStoreUserIdentity' and potentially other entity types, but there is no linking relationship. Add a foreign key to 'AspNetUsers' on the primary key properties and pointing to the primary key on another entity type mapped to 'AspNetUsers'.
[2022-07-08 08:43:16  FTL]  The entity type 'AspNetUsers' requires a primary key to be defined. If you intended to use a keyless entity type, call 'HasNoKey' in 'OnModelCreating'. For more information on keyless entity types, see https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2141943.
